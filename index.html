                        I am a serial entrepreneur with experience starting and operating 5 businesses in the last 30 years.  I love to learn!  I started as a Sales Agent at American General Life and Accident Insurance Co. Then I took over R&S Computers. This was a VAR (value added resale) company focusing on computer hardware and solutions.  This company’s focus was to research and provide turn-key and out of the box solutions to shipping companies world-wide. We were a Compaq service provider.  This meant we were authorized for warranty repair of Compaq servers and systems.  I became an MCSE (Microsoft Certified Software Engineer) for NT. This was a requirement to becoming a Compaq Engineer.

                        I Started DBRI Properties L.L.C. in 1998.  This is a property holding company that’s focus was and still is to purchase properties to rent and hold to provide a housing solution.  It taught me the systems to manage and operate within the housing rental markets.  
                    </p> 
                    <p>From there, I ran and operated the GlassDoctor of San Antonio L.L.C.  This was a glass repair company that replaces or installs residential, industrial and auto glass.  Although the industry was different then what I had previously done, I found that my skills from earlier businesses transferred very easily.</p>
                    <p>Back issues forced me to change my focus.  Loving the computer industry since I was very young it seemed the logical solution for my next work chapter.  I am currently enrolled in UTSA’s software development bootcamp.  I have found this to be so rewarding and fun.  I love the satisfaction of completing a project.  It has allowed me the challenge of learning new technologies and applying them to everyday problems.  The best part, is that every day is a new challenge.  I can’t wait to apply these skills to enable others to realize there business potential.  </p>
